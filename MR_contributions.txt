Spin Magnetoresistance (Pt/magnetic insulator interface):
Rxx and Rxy cos and sin(2alpha) respectively, should saturate with magnetic sublattices
https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.97.014417

Ordinary Hall Effect:
Rxy when B has an out of plane component (cos(beta))

Hanle Magnetoresistance (Pt):
Rxx and Rxy ferrromagnetic SMR like, quadratic with field, mostly temperature independent
http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.016603

Ordinary Magnetorestance (Pt):
Conduction electrons are displaced from their trajectories by Lorentz force (relevant for high H)
gives SMR-like contribution to Rxx and Rxy (not sure about the sign, apparently AFM-like)
goes like (H/rho)^(~1.8) -> Kohler's rule
so more relevant for low resistivity
temperature independent
good way to check is to do gamma scan, where we don't expect OHE or SMR in Rxx
http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.6.034007

Proximity Effect induced Anisotropic Magnetoresistance (Pt):
SMR - like contribution, which should be more relevant for thinner Pt at lower temperatures

Paramagnetic SMR:
above TN an SMR signal can be observed which increases with increasing field
this should be a FM-like SMR signal
It should also go like 1/T (distinguishable from HMR)
